# Triple T

>As professional Tic-Tac-Toe players, my wife and I play Tic-Tac-Toe all the time. By day's end, the house is littered with scraps of paper covered with Tic-Tac-Toe grids. We want to play the game on our computer so we can save paper and do our part to prevent global warming.

This game begins with prompts for the users to enter their names for the scoreboard.  Next they are asked if X or O will go first.  Then they begin play by alternately clicking squares on the gameboard.  When one of the players gets three in a row, a pop-up announces the winner and the new score and the scoreboard is updated.  When the players click the OK button on the pop-up, the board is setup for a new game.

# Future Versions
I hope to include background graphics, a start-up sound effect, an animation of the game before play starts with the computer generating random moves, a reset button to restart a game, special effects to announce a winner and buttons to let the users select different backgrounds.
